This repository contains some useful public-domain libraries by
Julienne Walker, which I rescued from her now-defunct site
[eternallyconfuzzled.com][1].

I don't have anything to do with these libraries; I just like them and
didn't want to see them get lost.  I felt that putting them in a
Github repository would make them more accessible than having to go
spelunking for them in the [Wayback Machine][2].  Also, pull requests
can be accepted if any bugs are ever found.

In addition, I rescued the [tutorials](Tutorials) and
[articles](Articles) from Eternally Confuzzled, converted them to
[Markdown][3] using [Pandoc][4], and placed them in this repository,
as well.

## Tutorials
