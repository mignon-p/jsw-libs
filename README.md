This repository contains some useful public-domain libraries by
Julienne Walker, which I rescued from her now-defunct site
[eternallyconfuzzled.com][1].

I don't have anything to do with these libraries; I just like them and
didn't want to see them get lost.  I felt that putting them in a
Github repository would make them more accessible than having to go
spelunking for them in the [Wayback Machine][2].  Also, pull requests
can be accepted if any bugs are ever found.

In addition, I rescued the [tutorials](Tutorials) and
[articles](Articles) from Eternally Confuzzled, converted them to
[Markdown][3] using [Pandoc][4], and placed them in this repository,
as well.

## Tutorials

### Data Structures

| [Skip Lists][dst-skip]             | [jsw\_slib](jsw\_slib)       |

### Algorithms

| Tutorial                           | Library                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [Hashing][alg-hashing]             |                              |
| [Random Numbers][alg-rand]         | [jsw\_rand](jsw\_rand)       |
| [Sorting][alg-sorting]             |                              |

### Miscellaneous

* [Pointers][msc-pointers]
* [Windows Services Simplified][msc-winservice]

## Articles

* [Asymptotic Notation][art-bigo]
* [atoi() is evil!][art-atoi]
* [Using rand()][art-rand]

## Licensing

Both the libraries and the articles on Eternally Confuzzled were in
the public domain, as stated [here][1].  (Despite the contradictory
"Â© 2018 - Eternally Confuzzled" at the bottom of each page.)

## Tests

I (Patrick Pelletier) have added some tests for the jsw libraries.  To
run the tests, just run the script `test/run-tests.pl`.  You will need
to have Perl, gcc, and [valgrind][5] installed to run the tests.
